    Added Swedish (thanks goes to Adam Karlsson, IorX) and Portuguese translation (thanks goes to J. Almeida)

1.4.7
Bugfixes:

    Correctly handle hard links to currently open files

	
1.4.6
Bugfix:

    Correctly detect changes in root directories (such as C:) on Windows. This bug was introduced with "Correctly backup root directory on Linux" with the last client version. If you configured a client to do file backups of e.g. "C:\" you are affected and should upgrade.

	
1.4.5
Bugfixes:

    Correctly backup root directory on Linux
    Always look at file if basic info was changed
    Correctly check the values in image_letters for correctness (volume can be opened)
    Cache ntfs info correctly if it cannot be read from device (e.g. because of timeout). Fixes client connection error when querying capabilities

	
1.4.4
Critical bugfixes:

    Fixed potential file change detection issue which occurred if the indexing process was interrupted (e.g. via system shutdown). Caused changed files to not be loaded to the server during incremental file backups.
    Persist open files information to disk to load them again on service restart. Caused changed, currently open files to not be loaded to the server during incremental file backups, if the client service is restarted.

Bugfixes:

    Cache ntfs property of volumes for capability command in case drives react slowly. Added new enumeration of all non-usb ntfs formatted volumes.
    Enable end-to-end verification only for the next backup
    Keep file modification times if no file in directory changed (this would cause unnecessary file backups during incremental file backups)
    For ReFS: Switch to different indexing mode if FSCTL_ENUM_USN_DATA is not supported. Also added USNv3 support (not seen in the wild yet, though)
    Do not crash if blocks of a file which could not be opened are requested
    Fixed error handling in change journal watcher
    Fixed log rotation

	
1.4.3
Bugfixes:

    Improved error handling while watching for file changes. In case of errors it falls back to MFT queries and if that fails it marks the volume as failed. This fixes a bug which caused UrBackup to not backup changes in some error situations.
    Added log rotation on Windows
    Better logging if temporary file cannot be created, and create temporary directory if it was created

Changes:

    Added Czech translation (thanks goes to Ales Hermann). Updated other translations and translation attribution.

	
1.4.2
Bugfixes:

    If image letters is ALL, only backup NTFS formatted volumes
    Correctly hash files which were not hashed previously (e.g. because the client was connected locally)

	
1.4.1
Bugfixes:

    Fixed tray icon not installing with installers downloaded from server
    Quit executable when window is closed
    Correctly transfer error message, if the error occurs on the first file transmitted

	
1.4
	No changes


1.4 RC3
    Don't log token authentication failures as error log messages
    Added new "internetonly" client parameter
    Changed writer error loglevel to warning
    Use the hostname if it is identical to the FQDN except for casing

	
1.4 RC2
	Fixed client update mechanism.


1.4 RC1
Changes:

    Fixed bug where the status screen was crashing
    Put temporary files into a folder and delete it on startup
    Properly close handles to files on timeouts
    Don't get stuck if receiving hash data for incremental image fails
    Fixed bug where one of the hashes in the "block differences - hashed" transfer mode was calculated incorrectly. This caused unnecessary file blocks to be transferred during incremental file backups. Using Server 1.4RC1 with previous clients and vise versa causes even more unnecessary data to be transferred. This bug does, however, not affect file correctness.

	
1.4 beta 3
	Fixed bug in shadow copy deletion of own/old shadow copies.


1.4 beta 2
Changes:

    Added explanation of writer failures and consequences in the VSS log messages and lowered logging-level to warning.

    Update start time of shadow copy while imaging, so that it does not time out on really long image backups (more than one week)
    Filter useless error messages in connection with change journal entries

    Don't require change journal close for change entry to be written. Increase entry cache time.

    Retry snapshot operation if writer failed and has the retryable error
    Trim identities when loading them from identity file
    Scan for changed hard links on Windows
    Always lookup the urbackup\ directory on the filesystem because changes there are ignored in the change journal watcher
    Automatically add pagefile.sys and hiberfil.sys to the exclude list
